# StrawBerry Research and Implementation

This project will focus on a state-of-the-art study of the StrawBerry method for automatically synthesizing web-service behavior protocols from WSDL interfaces. In parallel, we will implement a working prototype of the StrawBerry system to validate and experiment with the approach.

Planned work includes:

- Research and documentation of the StrawBerry method and related literature
- Design of a reference workflow for dependency synthesis, testing-based refinement, and protocol generation
- Implementation of the core StrawBerry pipeline
- Evaluation on representative WSDL-based services
